# Quantitative Mathematics for Quant Analysts

This repository is a structured, topic-wise project aimed at mastering the mathematical foundations required for Quantitative Analyst roles. Each topic includes:

- Pen-and-paper theory explanations (`theory_notes.md`)
- Excel-based implementations (`/excel/` folder)
- Python code notebooks (`.ipynb`)
