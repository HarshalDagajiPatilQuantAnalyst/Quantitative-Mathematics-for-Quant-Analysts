# Quantitative Mathematics for Quant Analysts

This repository is a structured, topic-wise project aimed at mastering the mathematical foundations required for Quantitative Analyst roles. Each topic includes:

- Pen-and-paper theory explanations (`theory_notes.md`)
- Excel-based implementations (`/excel/` folder)
- Python code notebooks (`.ipynb`)

## Topics Covered

1. Linear Algebra
2. Probability & Statistics
3. Calculus
4. Optimization
5. Stochastic Calculus
6. Numerical Methods

## Showcase Case Studies

- **Black-Scholes Option Pricing** (Stochastic Calculus + Python)
- **Portfolio Optimization with Constraints** (Linear Algebra + Optimization)
- **PCA-based Factor Analysis** (Statistics + Linear Algebra)

## Goal
To bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and real-world quant finance problems using Excel and Python.
